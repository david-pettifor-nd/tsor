# The Scarab of Ra
Based on an old Macintosh System 6 shareware game, this is a First-Person-Shooter take on this classic game.

## The Objective
You are a graduate student in Archeology and with the recent discovery of the great Pyramid of Ra, you are tasked with exploring the maze-like structure in searching for the ancient and fable artifacts of Ra.

## The Game
Done in Unity, the game starts you off in a 3x3 maze.  Each level has a key placed somewhere in the maze.  The entrance is always in the lower-left corner and the exit always in the upper-right.  The exit door is the only one with a key hole, and each level only has 1 small brass key to make it to the next level.

### The Artifacts
There are three artifacts currently planned, each one only appearing once per game and having a small chance of appearing at the time the next level is created.  These include the Scarab of Ra (currently in game), the Staff of Ra (not yet added), and the Crown of Ra (not yet added).

If you can collect the artifacts and reach the end of your current level, you win!  If you miss one of the artifacts and traverse to the next level, you can never win!  Artifacts (and anything else you may pick up) are carried with you from level to level (except the brass key).

## Features
At the moment, only one feature exists: the map.  Pressing "M" at any point will switch your view to a "bird's eye view" of the level, shedding light on the paths of the level you've already visted.  The remaining paths in which you have not yet visited will remain dark!  Using the standard W-S-A-D keys will move you across the map, and the scroll will zoom your view in and out.  Hint!: Items not yet picked up will show in the map view!

## Downloading
With each update, I push compiled versions for Mac, Windows, and Linux.  These should be easy to find, but you will need the corresponding "data" directories that match each one.
